MCP Hackathon Project: AI Agentic System
Welcome to the repository for our submission to the Agents & MCP Hackathon 2025. This project explores the integration of AI agents with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create interactive and intelligent systems.

üöÄ Project Overview
This project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of AI agents in processing and responding to user inputs by leveraging the MCP framework. The system is designed to:

Accept user queries or commands.

Process the input using AI models.

Generate appropriate responses or actions.

Provide an interactive interface for user engagement.

üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure
agent.ipynb: Jupyter notebook detailing the development and testing of the AI agent.

code_client.py: Client-side script to send requests to the MCP server.

gradio_mcp.py: Script to launch the Gradio interface integrated with MCP.

igdb_api.ipynb: Notebook demonstrating the integration with the IGDB API for game-related data.

server.py: Backend server handling requests and interfacing with the AI agent.

.gitignore: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

.python-version: Specifies the Python version used.

pyproject.toml: Project metadata and dependencies.

uv.lock: Lock file for dependencies.

.gradio/flagged: Directory for storing flagged examples from the Gradio interface.
